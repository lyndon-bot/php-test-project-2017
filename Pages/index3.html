<h1 id="howtoguide"><strong><font color="#d41e3a">HOW TO GUIDE</font></strong></h1>
<h3 id="employeeprospect"><strong><font color="#c7c8ca">Employee Prospects</font><font color="#ffffff"> - Employers can view videos from your references about you!</font></strong></h3>
<br>
Job applicants, along with your polished resume and cover letter, it is also a very important factor to choose the best references.  Having good references could be the deciding factor in landing that dream job.  At <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i</font>nquire<font color="#c7c8ca">a</font>bout<font color="#c7c8ca">m</font>e.com</strong>, you send an <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong> video request to your reference of choice.  In-turn, your reference uploads a video speaking of your positive attributes, strengths, and skill set.  Verification of your references shows you’re being truthful in not only the positions you’ve held in the past, but also legitimizes the person who serves as your reference.
<br><br>
How does it work?  It’s easy!  Send an <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong> reference request to former supervisors or/and professional colleagues.  Your reference video is then uploaded to your <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong> page. On job applications (or cover letter), you direct the potential employer to your <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i</font>nquire<font color="#c7c8ca">a</font>bout<font color="#c7c8ca">m</font>e.com</strong>, you send an <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong>, <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong> page.  You can also send a link (my <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong> page) to the hiring manager or HR department to view.  The potential employer can then view your reference videos, pictures, and colleague recommendations.  It’s that simple!
<br><br>

On <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i</font>nquire<font color="#c7c8ca">a</font>bout<font color="#c7c8ca">m</font>e.com</strong>, your visitors can ‘like’ (<img src="Links/iamlikebutton.png" width="20" height="20">) statements on your <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong> page, showing credibility of who you are, and highlighting your career achievements.

<br>
Curious to know who has visited your page, or viewed your reference videos?  <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i</font>nquire<font color="#c7c8ca">a</font>bout<font color="#c7c8ca">m</font>e.com</strong> offers a detailed list of employers or colleagues who have viewed your page.  No more inquiring or guessing about what your job references are saying about you, or if you are a finalist for a job.  Need a letter of recommendation?  Why not let videos of past supervisors or colleagues do the work for you?  No more will there be a need to constantly ask colleagues to serve as a reference, or the need to request a hand written letter of recommendation.  Reference videos can be used time and time again, particularly, if kept generic.

<p id="howtorecordvideo"><strong><font color="#c7c8ca">How to Record a Video</font></strong> <br>
There are several methods to create and record a reference video or about me video, and most desktop and laptop computers are already equipped with a web camera that allows you to do so. To record a video, you can use one of many free programs: QuickTime®, iMovie®, Debut®, and Apowersoft® are just a few that allows you to record and save videos to upload to your <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong> page. While a desktop computer provides a more stable foundation, a laptop can easily be fixed on a solid platform, to make a video recording. Some programs are designed for a PC setup, others for a Mac, and some are available for both PC and Mac work environments.  NOTE: The suggested formats are recommendations only, and inquireaboutme.com is not in partnership with QuickTime®, iMovie®, Debut®, and Apowersoft®.
<br>
<p id="sendvideorequest"><strong><font color="#c7c8ca">Video Requests</font></strong> <br>
  The accepted formats to upload videos to your <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong> page are: .m4v, .mpg, .avi, and .wmv. These are the formats needed to upload ‘About Me’ or ‘Accolades’ videos, as well as ‘Reference Videos’.
  <br><br>
<p id="otherformats"><strong><font color="#c7c8ca">Other Formats</font></strong> <br>
For <strong><font color="#c7c8ca">i. a</font>m</strong> pages ‘About Me’ that will use Powerpoint® documents, the accepted formats are .mov, and .pptx. Animation and commercial videos should be saved in the following formats: .m4v, .mpg, and wmv. Ideal opportunity to post professional videos that are customized, and highlight your skill set.
For all formats, simply browse to the localized area on your hard drive, and upload to the respective area.
<br><br>
<p id="creatingenviro"><strong><font color="#c7c8ca">Creating the Ideal Recording Environment</font></strong> <br>
The area that is viewed in the web camera live space, should be clean and an office set up is ideal. The area should be well-lit, with no additional movement in the background, or sound (other than your voice). Your attire should be professional, as though you’re conducting a Skype® interview. Practice before recording, and only upload a solid presentation, with no breaks in conversation. Your video should be short, with the ideal recording time being 1 to 4 minutes (no more than 5 minutes). Eye contact should remain entirely on the web camera, reading from notes is not ideal, and speaking fluently (no pauses) makes your statement look more genuine. To end your video, have your hand and mouse ready to stop recording, eliminating the need to look away from the web camera. Remember, the goal is to present yourself in the best professional manner possible. This information should be shared to those that will serve as a reference for you as well.

My name is Jane Doe, and I am an accomplished Creative Director with a notable record of achievement in the print, web, and digital design sector. I have over 10 years professional experience working with Fortune 500 and International Brand companies.

I have successfully managed and directed teams with advertising strategies in the US and Global Markets, and monitored every step of brand execution to ensure adherence to International guidelines.

Being a leader is a natural trait for me, and I believe in creating a positive work environment for the teams I manage, to keep them interested, and to help them thrive in their position.
				
My philosophy to being a creative professional is simple, to find the best solution to meet objectives, and to take projects to heights unforeseen.</i>

<p id="whattosayemployeerefex"><strong><font color="#c7c8ca">What to Say (Employee Prospect/Video Reference)</font></strong> <br>
A ‘Reference’ video for an employee should be from a former supervisor, colleague, manager, director, or a person who monitored your community service. The wording should be similar to words used in a recommendation letter. Include interactions with the person to whom you’re serving as a reference for, and length of time employed. The person’s skill set, strengths, and any positive moments should be reflected.  Talk as though you’re speaking directly to someone who is checking on a prospect’s references for employment. 
The following displays examples of what to say when serving as a reference. NOTE: The following is a fictitious example only, and is not indicative of a partnership with a place of business.

<i>My name is Robert Dow, Brand Director at Napple, and I had the opportunity to serve as Jane Doe’s manager for 8 years, known her for 10 years, and have personally witnessed her professional work ethic, positive attitude, and pleasant demeanor. 

Jane served as the Creative Strategist Manager at Napple, and was in charge of advertising and marketing strategies in the US and Globally.  Jane worked closely with me in planning and developing strategies to better promote our brand, particularly in an International market. She is very responsible and professional, and her ambition was evident in her ideas and performance. 

Jane has a thorough knowledge of multiple programs affiliated with print, digital, and web, has a keen eye for what ‘pops’ and what is considered eye catching. She is very much a student of her craft, and is diligent with staying abreast with new technology. She stood out amongst her peers, maintaining a distinct stature on positive change. Her focus was to make a difference, and be an influence within her cohorts.

Jane demonstrated a great interest and dedication to the field of advertising, and I expect her to have a bright future in the field. She is truly an ideal employee, one I would rehire again, and I recommend Jane with confidence.

<i>Hello, 

I’m Ashley Neil, and I’m a senior and honors student at Parks Heights Senior High School in Charlotte, NC. My goal is to become a Computer Programmer, where I have a natural flair for understanding programming languages, and enjoy learning new technology.  

I taught myself Java Script, Python, and Ruby, and have become proficient utilizing all three simultaneously. 

My goal is to further my education and learn more about writing programs at the collegiate level, and take advantage 
of career options that will enable me to succeed in the field.</i>

<p id="whattosaystudentprospref"><strong><font color="#c7c8ca">What to Say (Student Prospect/Video Reference)</font></strong> <br>
A ‘Reference’ video for an student prospect should be from a former school administrator, teacher, counselor, colleague, or a person who monitored your community service. The wording should be similar to words used in a recommendation letter.  Include interactions with the person to whom you’re serving as a reference for, and length of 
time employed.  The person’s skill set, strengths, and any positive moments should be reflected.  Talk as though you’re speaking directly to someone who is checking
on a prospect’s references for school admission, or admission into an organization. 
<br><br>
The following displays an example of what to say when serving as a reference. NOTE: The following is a fictitious example only, and is not indicative of a partnership with a place of business, school, or university.

<i>Hello,

I’m Andy Newman, Guidance Counselor for Parks Heights Senior High School in Charlotte, NC, and it is my pleasure to recommend Ashley Neil for admission to your undergraduate program.

I have witnessed this studious, bright young woman develop both academically and personally into a mature individual, who is dedicated to succeeding in life. Her grades have been above average for 3 years in all of her courses, and as a result, she’s also an honor roll and honor society student. Her academic accomplishments are stellar, and she’s in the top 3 of her graduating class. 

Ashley is also an active participant in extra-curriculum activities such as the Science Club, Student Council, Latin Club, and a captain of the Cheerleader squad. Ashley’s teachers describe her as an exceptional, perceptive, and insightful student, who has incredible focus. 

Ashley plans to study Computer Science, and she has excelled in understanding different computer programming languages. She has put an abundance of hours towards achieving her ultimate goal, to become a Computer Programmer. Last summer, Ashely was one of three students nationally who received an internship with Nortel. She was so impressive, that the company executives offered her an extended internship via satellite for the next 4 years, while she attends college.

It is rare to meet a student like Ashley, and she has my enthusiastic recommendation. She is intelligent, strong willed, and a person who has a clear sense of direction and purpose. I am confident she will bring the same intensity to the university of her choice, and will be a top achiever in her collegiate courses. 

Ashley’s future is bright, and I am excited to see how far her educational and professional journey will take her.</i>
